    <p>Hello everyone. I come from Zambia. I am the last born in a family of 3.
        My siblings and I were raised by a single mother. I love her so much.
        We are all members of the church. My siblings and I are returned missionaries.
        I'm not married yet, still searching.
    </p>

        I enjoy serving in the church, currently I'm serving as the Branch President for 
        my home branch. It is kind of weird having members I looked up to as my leaders from my primary
        years now addressing me as their leader. It is such a humbling experience.
        I feel inadequate at times but hey this is the Lord's work and we ought to trust Him 
        and do our part and let Him prevail. I believe that Jesus is the Christ and 
        that He died for each and everyone of us. I know that by emulating the Savior, He will bless
        us with eternal life.

        I love this program so much. I never knew I was this interested in programming until I started coding.
        I am looking forward to learn from every one of you.
